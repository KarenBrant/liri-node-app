# liri-node-app
**Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs**
* Program to get information from Twitter, Spotify, or OMDB movie database.
* **General Information:**
* Developer - Karen Brant,
* Languages/Frameworks - node.js. 
* Getting started: This program allows the user to input one of the following commands:
1. my-tweets
2. spotify-this-song
3. movie-this
4. do-what-it-says

If #2 is chosen, then the user should type a space and then enter a song name.  If the song name has an apostrophe in it, then quotes need to surround the name.  Otherwise quotes are not necessary.  
If #3 is chosen, then the user should type a space and then a movie name. If the movie name has an apostrophe in it, then quotes need to surround the name.  Otherwise quotes are not necessary.  
#1 will show a list of 20 tweets
#2 will show some information about a song:  artist, name, preview URL and album name
#3 will list a movie, release year, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, country where produced, language, plot and actors
#4 will do what a random.txt file tells it to do - currently it is to print information about the song 'I want it that way'.

* Screenshots show how this works:
